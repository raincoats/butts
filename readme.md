#butts.py

This is just a python module I use for formatting output. I have a few other functions in there, like `which()` which works like UNIX `which` (stolen from stackoverflow tho), and `classdump()`, which I think sort of works like a formatted `dir()`, but I don't know python too well so I don't know.

### Formatting example:
