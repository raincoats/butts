#butts.py

This is just a python module I use for formatting output. I have a few other functions in there, like `which()` which works like UNIX `which` (stolen from stackoverflow tho), and `classdump()`, which I think sort of works like a formatted `dir()`, but I don't know python too well so I don't know.

### Formatting example:

### dir_XL() example

(it's literally just `dir()` but it formats the results and gets rid of all the \_\_weird\_\_ \_\_things\_\_ \_\_like\_\_ \_\_this\_\_)
